// Generic hooks - can be used across multiple features
// Currently no generic hooks - all hooks are feature-specific

// Note: Feature-specific hooks are kept in their respective feature directories
// - useCanvas -> features/canvas/hooks/
// - useMediaStream, usePeerConnection, useSocketId -> features/video-chat/hooks/
// - This maintains feature isolation and prevents tight coupling
